# Seasons
#### A game that changes with the seasons

# Description
Mangala, the God of Mars, has stopped the flow of seasons by kidnapping Mother Nature, and threatens to take over the Earth and transform it into a wasteland like Mars. Only Anemoi, the son of Mother Nature and the hero of the story, has the ability to bring the seasons back and save the Earth. Using his minor control of the Seasons, Anemoi sets out on an adventure to stop Mangala and his goons and restore the seasonal cycle to Earth.
